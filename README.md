# Dice Roll Simulation in MATLAB

This project simulates rolling two six-sided dice 1000 times using MATLAB and visualizes the distribution of the sums.

## Project Description

The simulation generates random rolls for two dice, sums the results, and plots a histogram showing how often each possible sum (from 2 to 12) occurs. This demonstrates the probability distribution of dice rolls.

## Files Included

- `DiceRollSimulation.m` — MATLAB script that runs the simulation and generates the plot.
- `plotResults.png` — Histogram image showing the distribution of sums.

## How to Run

1. Open `DiceRollSimulation.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script. It will simulate the dice rolls and generate a histogram plot.
3. The plot will be saved as `plotResults.png` in the current folder.
